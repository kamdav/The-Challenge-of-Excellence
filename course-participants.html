                <li>That with teamwork you can achieve so much more</li>

                <li>It has inspired me to go to university when I leave college</li>

                <li>Amazing, life changing, friend making event</li>

                <li>I enjoyed learning how to set a business up and the balance of football and business were just right. I loved the way everything related back to setting up a business. I learned a lot, not just about business but also about my own talents</li>

                <li>I liked learning how to start up my own business, the knowledge that I will need to make IT work.  I would recommend this to others because it helps you how to cope with having stresses </li>

            <p><b class="blue">A Parent – JC</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i>“The programme was very well structured and the practical nature of the course certainly fired my son with enthusiasm.  There was a good balance between theory and practice and this meant that he was able to translate ideas into reality.  As a result of the programme I have seen my son’s confidence grow and he is now more prepared to use his initiative in ‘every day’ situations and equally important, he is able and prepared to take responsibility for his actions.  I would recommend this programme to other students and also encourage parents to support their children in being active participants.”</i>  </p>

            <p><b class="blue">Alumni in contact some years AFTER participation …</b></p>

            <p><i>“Hi, I was just wanting to let you know that I have got in to the University of Teesside to do business studies. I shall be starting on Monday. I wanted to say thank you to you and the rest of the group as I don’t think I would have applied for university if it wasn’t for you helping me to believe in myself and building my self-confidence. Hope you are all ok.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“Hello, I’m sure you probably don’t remember me but I participated and won Tsu’Chu Biz in 2008.  I wanted to let you know that I have my own business and I am studying radiography at Hertfordshire University.  I really owe a lot of this to you all for being so supportive and pushing me out of my comfort zone.  It really helped my confidence and obviously did my business mind wonders, thank you again”</i></p>

            <p><i>“If your sponsors knew the impact it had on us from our point of view as opposed to just yours they’d see just how wonderful and useful the course is!  Public speaking especially at such a great venue and teambuilding skills are just a few things we walked away with.  To be honest if my college hadn’t invited me along I would never know a thing about business ‘til today.  I never took business and right now as I train to be a nurse I’m looking into the future and I’m growing more interested in medicine.  With the knowledge I gained from the course I can see that it isn’t impossible for me to one day own my own practice.”</i></p>

            <p><i>“I’m not sure you remember me I came with my college, George Greens sixth form in December 2008.  Our partnership group won the Tsu’Chu Biz (business plan competition).  You have paved my life to a better business future.  I won another entrepreneurial competition in East London two years after and realised my potential would not have been ignited if it wasn’t for you!”</i></p>

She did so well in her GCSEs and was predicted A’s but got A* with a distinction in Business and ICT. We are very proud and think that the business opportunity that you gave her in Year 9 helped her gain the confidence and belief in herself that she has today.  Best wishes.”</i></p>
