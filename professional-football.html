            <p><b class="blue">ARSENAL FOOTBALL CLUB, Director - Ken Friar OBE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>“In these tough economic times, it is refreshing to see an initiative like Tsu’Chu Biz that is proactively teaching young people essential skills that will benefit them in later life and as they enter employment. Arsenal has a proud history of nurturing potential and helping young people to become the best they can be, so we are delighted to support the programme and recognise those involved.”</i></p>

            <p><b class="blue">CHELSEA FOOTBALL CLUB, Community Director – Simon Taylor</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;   <i>“Chelsea Football Club has a long and proud history of engagement with our community. In 2008 Chelsea FC teamed up with former Nottingham Forest, Arsenal and England international footballer Tony Woodcock and The Challenge of Excellence to support the launch of Tsu’Chu Biz in the London boroughs, a scheme designed to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go on to university and give them a head start in entrepreneurship and business. </i></p>

            <p><i>The partnership we have had with Tsu’Chu Biz has been a unique collaboration between football, business and education and has showcased what can be achieved for the youth of our society when professionals from different walks of life combine their expertise for the common good.</i></p>

            <p><i>We feel that the Tsu’Chu Biz scheme demonstrates that football is much more than just a game, it is a vehicle to engage and motivate young people.   Designed to use examples, attitudes and knowledge from the game of professional football the course is highly relevant to young people’s lives and interests.  We have supported almost 800 young people from London boroughs through the Tsu’Chu Biz initiative encouraging them to be creative, enterprising and entrepreneurial, work at what they love and have a talent for and develop personally and socially.  We believe this initiative should go forward for many more young people and we are delighted that Tsu’Chu Biz is receiving the recognition it undoubtedly deserves. We highly recommend The Challenge of Excellence as a professional and values driven business partner and hope that government departments will take note of the high impact of this course for our young people and the excellent results achieved by so many for so many.  We continue to strongly support Tsu’Chu Biz in its educational and societal endeavours.”</i></p>

            <p><b class="blue">DAVID DEIN, former Vice Chairman The Football Association and Arsenal FC</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;    <i>“It was fantastic to see these kids giving PowerPoint presentations of the business plans they had worked on and created after only four days of learning.  This is a truly inspirational course that teaches business and entrepreneurship through football….great for football, great for kids.  It gives them a real head start”.</i></p>

            <p><b class="blue">AL JAZIRA FOOTBALL CLUB, CEO – Phil Anderton</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i>“I thoroughly enjoyed being a judge for the Tsu’Chu Biz course.  The students had clearly gained a very good understanding of practical business planning and exhibited genuine entrepreneurial flair.  I would recommend this course to all aspiring business men and women!”</i></p>

            <p><b class="blue">TONY WOODCOCK, former Nottingham Forest, Arsenal, FC Cologne and England International Footballer</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>“We are delighted to be in The Guildhall showcasing what young people can achieve when they are motivated, passionate and  informed about life-relevant subjects and able to use their talents in a creative way.... it’s good for them, good for the local economy, good for jobs, good for the community.... it’s a sign that innovative education is playing its part in this challenging social and economic climate”.</i></p>
