            <p class="running-para">Professional sportsmen and sportswomen performing at their peak are like machines in a ‘state of flow’.  Such athletes manage and move through challenges with a high degree of expertise and efficiency yet with spirit and flair.   You will ‘know’ in your body and your mind when you have or are experiencing times like that.  Times when everything is working … physically, mentally, emotionally, even spiritually.</p>

            <img class="right karate-kick" src="img/karate-kick.jpg">

            <p>When however, you know you are <i>not</i> at your peak, you are ‘out of a state of flow’ or are you in anti-flow, or in a state of lack, or stoppage, or want?   There could be many reasons for being in a state of lack or stoppage or want.  Personal relations at home can impact on your performance; children, parent or family issues; reading the media about yourself, dealing with the press; it could be an injury or other physical challenge; it could be relations at work.  It may simply be that being in a state of flow for <i>every</i> performance is actually <i>not</i> what you want?  Simple as that!  Or is it?</p>

            <p>A highly respected Manager at a Premier League Football Club once told me that there was “30% more” in one of his top players.  Could this apply to you?  Do you have more in there? </p>

            <p>Any number of reasons could be responsible for not rising to your potential as often as you would like, or as often as you could.  Knowing those reasons and doing something constructive about them is an example of what contemporary counselling works with.</p>

            <p>Counselling for sports professionals works at a range of levels, in a variety of ways, all tailored to the client, their personal and professional life and the competing demands of both.  Counselling for sports professionals will challenge you.   But it will also provide expertise to push you to be the best you can be as often as you want to be.</p>

            <p>You may be aspiring to reach the top and you are almost there, or you are at the top and you want to stay there, or you may be preparing for a new season and are thinking ‘what now’?  Who am I now?</p>

            <p>If you aspire to excellence and if you would like to know more about contemporary counselling for professional athletes, please <a class="grey-link" href="mailto:thecounsellor@challengeofexcellence.com">contact me</a>.  I would be happy to have an informal and confidential initial chat without any obligation.</p>
